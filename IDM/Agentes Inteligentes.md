## AI
	"Branch of computer science that seeks automatization of intelligent behavior."
	"Artificial Intelligence is the study of systems that act in such a way that to any       external observer they seem intelligent."
Strong AI:
	"Giving a computer program sufficient processing power and providing it with enough intelligence, a computer that can think and is conscious as a human can be created"
Weak AI:
	"Intelligent behavior can be modeled and used by computers to solve complex problems."
Artificial narrow AI (ANI):
	These models are designed to focus on very specific tasks and do not have the capacity to learn
Artificial general AI (AGI):
	General Inteligence models are able to learn and mimic basic human thinking
Types of AI:
	Reactive AI: Can only respond to the current state of the world. They do not have any memory of past evenets, and they cannot plan for the future.
	Limited-memory: Can remember past events and use this  information to make decisions. Cannot reason about the future or understand the intentions of other agents.
	Theory of mind: Can understand the thoughts and intentions  of other agents. Cooperate with other agents and to achieve goals that would be impossible for a single agent.
Prueba de Turing:
	Prueba hecha por Alan Turing, para dar una definicion operacional de inteligencia. La computadora pasa la prueba si un interrogador humano despues de plantear unas preguntas, no puede decir  si las respuestas vienen de un humano o de una computadora
Disciplinas de AI:
	Natural language processing, Knowledge representation, automated reasoning,machine learning , computer vision and robotics.
